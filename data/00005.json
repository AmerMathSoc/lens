In spite of its biological importance, little is known about PRC2 architecture and subunit organization. Here, we present the first three-dimensional electron microscopy structure of the human PRC2 complex bound to its cofactor AEBP2. Using a novel internal protein tagging-method, in combination with isotopic chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry, we have localized all the PRC2 subunits and their functional domains and generated a detailed map of interactions. The position and stabilization effect of AEBP2 suggests an allosteric role of this cofactor in regulating gene silencing. Regions in PRC2 that interact with modified histone tails are localized near the methyltransferase site, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the chromatin-based regulation of PRC2 activity."

It is also known that PRC2 requires a particular protein co-factor (called AEBP2) to perform this function. Moreover, it has been established that PRC2 silences genes by adding two or three methyl (CH3) groups to a particular amino acid (Lysine 27) in one of the proteins (histone H3) that DNA strands wrap around in the nucleus of cells. However, despite its biological importance, little is known about the detailed architecture of PRC2."

In particular, the protein domains within the PRC2 that interact with the histone markers are close to the site that transfer the methyl groups, which helps to explain how the gene silencing activity of the PRC2 complex is regulated. The results should pave the way to a more complete understanding of how PRC2 and its cofactor are able to silence genes."

PcG and TrxG complexes are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes and regulate chromatin structure through recruitment to Polycomb or Trithorax Responsive Elements (PREs, TREs) for gene silencing or activation, respectively (Schuettengruber et al., 2007). Within the PcG protein complexes, Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays an essential role in chromatin modification by di- and tri-methylating Lys 27 of Histone H3 (H3K27me2/3) (Cao et al., 2002; Czermin et al., 2002; Muller et al., 2002; Kirmizis et al., 2004). In higher eukaryotes, high levels of H3K27me3 are typically associated with transcriptional repression and gene silencing. The importance of the PcG protein in this process is emphasized by the observation that deletion of any of its components in mice results in early embryonic lethality or severe defects during development (O'Carroll et al., 2001; Pasini et al., 2004)."

      "content": "The PRC2 core, conserved from Drosophila to humans, is composed of four proteins that add up to about 230 kDa (Figure 1A) (see Margueron and Reinberg, 2010 for a recent review): EED (present in different isoforms), either one of the two methyltranferases Ezh1 or Ezh2 (Ezh1/2), Suz12, and either RbAp46 or RbAp48 (RbAp46/48). Both Ezh1 and Ezh2 contain enzymatic methyl-transferase activity within a C-terminal SET (Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste, Trithorax) domain. PRC2 complexes containing Ezh1 have lower enzymatic activity than those containing Ezh2, and target a subset of Ezh2 genes (Margueron et al., 2008). Ezh2 activity appears to depend on interaction with both Suz12 and the WD40 domain in EED (Cao and Zhang, 2004a; Pasini et al., 2004; Yamamoto et al., 2004; Ketel et al., 2005). EED's WD40 beta propeller, in turn, interacts with H3K27me3 repressive marks. This interaction is proposed to promote the allosteric activation of PRC2 methyltransferase activity (Margueron et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2010). RbAp48 also contains a WD40 propeller required for interaction with both Suz12 and the first 10 residues of unmodified Histone H3 peptides (Nowak et al., 2011; Schmitges et al., 2011)."

A comprehensive picture, however, of the PRC2 complex and the manner in which its different components interact to coordinate the regulated methyl-transferase activity remains elusive. In this study we present the first structure of the entire PRC2 holoenzyme in complex with AEBP2, describing its subunit architecture and the important interactions between their domains. These results contribute significantly to our structural understanding of this chromatin regulator, allowing us to suggest a possible molecular mechanism for PRC2's role in gene silencing."

      "content": "Since the AEBP2 cofactor is known to stably interact with the PRC2 complex and is required for optimal enzymatic activity (Cao and Zhang, 2004b), we added AEBP2 to the expression system, with the hope of locking the PRC2 complex in a conformation, both more active and more stable. We overexpressed the five-component PRC2-AEBP2 complex using the shorter isoform of AEBP2 protein, which is missing an extended unstructured region present in the longest isoform. Stoichiometric and biochemically homogeneous PRC2-AEPB2 complex was purified from insect cell lysate by affinity chromatography using a StrepII tag on the AEBP2 subunit, followed by size exclusion chromatography (Figure 1B). The subunits of the purified complex appeared to be stoichiometric by SDS page, although we could not rule out the presence of a small excess of AEBP2, as this subunit was utilized for tag-based purification. In our EM images we observed a small percentage of very small particles, which could be attributed to views of the complex oriented perpendicular to the plane of the grid, or to the presence of partial complexes (even AEBP2 by itself). These smaller particles were not considered in the generation of the 3D reconstruction (see ‘Materials and methods’). While inclusion of the cofactor significantly improved the quality of the 2D class averages in EM analysis (Figure 1D, top row), both detailed inspection and attempts to pursue a 3D reconstruction (not shown) indicated that the stability of the complex remained limiting. In order to preserve complex stability for further structural analysis, we mildly cross-linked the PRC2-AEBP2 complexes using 0.015% glutaraldehyde. Under these conditions we saw no apparent aggregation of the complex (Figure 1C). Importantly, comparison of class averages of the non cross-linked and the cross-linked sample (Figure 1D, bottom row), shows that the cross-linking had a positive effect on the stability of the complex, as judged by the increased detail in the class averages (for similar number of particles and classes). Class averages show PRC2 having an elongated shape, with top and bottom density regions that are joined at a narrow central point (Figure 1D)."

      "content": "Given the lack of structural information for the PRC2 complex, we carried out ab initio structural determination using the Random Conical Tilt (RCT) method (Radermacher et al., 1987) (Figure 2). Tilted and untilted image pairs were collected (Figure 2A), and 20 reference-free 2D class averages were calculated from the untilted classes (Figure 2B). RCT reconstructions were generated for each class average using the corresponding tilted images (Figure 2B,C). A four-lobed organization was evident in all the resulting models, indicating that the complex likely assumes one major architectural state. Concurrently, we collected a large dataset (∼40,000 particles) of untilted images, which were used to generate 1000 reference-free 2D class averages. Euler angles were assigned to these class averages, using each of the 20 RCT reconstructions as reference models. The results showed that the class averages were aligned in 3D in a self-consistent fashion, producing a similar complex architecture at the low resolution expected at this stage, irrespective of the RCT structure used as a reference (data not shown). Not surprisingly, Euler assignment using the RCT model from the most populated class gave a reconstruction that had the most structural detail (Figure 2C, class 4). This reconstruction was then used as an initial model (Figure 3A) for multiple rounds of projection-based angular refinement for single particles of the full 0° dataset (Penczek et al., 1994). The final refined structure has a resolution of 21 Å, based on the 0.5 Fourier shell correlation criteria (Figure 3B) (van Heel and Schatz, 2005). Due to the shape of the complex and its tendency to lie flat on the grid, we do not have an even distribution of views. However, views around the longitudinal axis of the model (vertical axis in the Euler plot) are well represented (Figure 3C). The quality of our model in representing the experimental images was confirmed by comparing the re-projected 3D reconstruction of the PRC2-AEBP2 complex with reference-free class averages (Figure 3D)."

In the upper part of the structure, Arm 1 spans the width of the complex horizontally, connecting lobes A and B. These lobes have additional interactions closer to the center of the particle. Arm 2 runs in a more vertical direction, starting at Lobe A and continuing vertically to the lower half of the structure, where it merges with Lobe C and D. Lobe A and D both have distinct ring-like shapes that are consistent with the propeller-like WD40 motifs of EED and RbAp48 (Figure 4, blue). These two WD40 domains are the only regions in the PRC2 complex for which atomic structures are presently available."

This technique has been successfully utilized in several laboratories during recent years to aid in characterizing the organization of multi-subunit protein complexes (Gingras et al., 2007; Maiolica et al., 2007; Ciferri et al., 2008; Rappsilber, 2011). For cross-linking analysis, we used DSSG, a homo-bifunctional cross-linker reacting with primary amines in lysine side chains or protein N-termini spaced ∼7 Å apart. We identified about 60 intra- or inter-molecular sites of interaction within the PRC2-AEBP2 complex (Figure 5; Supplementary file 1). While some of these interactions confirm previous biochemical data, others had never been described before and thus significantly expanded our knowledge of the PRC2 organization. In this report we include all the identified cross-linking interactions (Supplementary file 1). None of them proved in contradictions with previous reports or published crystal structures. Salient cross-linked Lysines are described in the following section, indicated as [Kn], where n represents the residue number of the protein."

We found two additional interactions between EED and other PRC2 components (Figure 5), one connecting the WD40 domain of EED [K433] with a loop between the second and the third Zn fingers of AEBP2 [K118/121], and the other linking the N-terminal region of EED [K19/20] with a region downstream of the first SANT domain of Ezh2 [K241/243] (Figure 5)."

The peptide centered at residues [K210/217/222] binds the second SANT domain of Ezh2 [K510/514/515], associates with the VEFS domain of Suz12 [K650], and is also cross-linked to the same region of AEBP2 [K118/121] that interacts with EED. Interestingly, this region of AEBP2, which contains the last two Zn finger domains [K95–K166], represents an intricate hub of interaction within the PRC2 complex. In addition to the interactions described above, cross-linking data show that AEBP2 binds to Ezh2's methyltransferase (SET)-containing C-terminus [K568–K740], as well as Suz12's Zn finger domain [K414–K534]. Furthermore, this region of Suz12 [K465/468–K483] also interacts with the methyltransferase domain of Ezh2 [K568–K740], suggesting a trimeric subcomplex that includes the SET domain of Ezh2 and the Zn fingers of Suz12 and AEBP2. Based on the observations that the Zn finger of AEBP2 and the C-terminal region of Suz12 together interact with both the N-terminal SANT and C-terminal SET domains of Ezh2, we propose that these two terminal regions of Ezh2 are within proximity to, or directly interacting with each other."

In addition, Schmitges and colleagues identified a region downstream of this Suz12 helix that plays an important role in stabilizing this interaction. Due to the absence of exposed lysines, we did not observe any cross-linking between the regions of RbAp48 and Suz12 shown to interact in the crystal structure. We did identify internal cross-linking within the WD40 propeller of RbAp48 [K114/120–K160–K215/220], consistent with the reported crystal structure of the isoform RbAp46 (PDB: 3CFS; Figure 6B). Additionally, we detect the presence of a set of three interactions between the WD40 domain of RbAp48 [K307/309] and the central portion of Suz12 [K167–K403] (Figure 5). This result suggests that the stabilizing downstream region described by Schmitges and colleagues might actually involve a larger portion of Suz12. In addition to this interaction with RbAp48, we also observe cross-linking between this region of Suz12 [K304–K403] and AEBP2 [K229–K274]. These residues of AEBP2 also interact with AEBP2's own Zn finger domain [K95–K166] (Figure 5). Taken together, these findings suggest that RbAp48, the central domain of Suz12, and AEBP2 undergo extensive interactions, in agreement with previous biochemical data (Cao and Zhang, 2004b)."

We used reference-free 2D classification to identify the position of the specific tags when compared to the corresponding class averages of the untagged complex (Figures 7–10). We concentrated our analysis on a specific view that we define as ‘canonical’ (corresponding to the first panel in Figure 4), which is both well represented in the EM images (for most, although not all of the tagged samples) and where the structural features of the complex are clear and well separated."

      "content": "We started by assigning the position of EED, which consists of a WD40 domain and an 80-residue N-terminus that is predicted to be unstructured (Han et al., 2007). Neither N-terminal MBP nor C-terminal GFP fusions assembled into stoichiometric or stable complexes. To overcome this limitation, we took advantage of the fact that the GFP N- and C-termini are in close spatial proximity and designed an expression vector to generate protein chimeras containing an internal GFP, connected by a short loop, at desired sites along the main protein chain. Using the crystal structure of EED (PDB: 2QXV), we designed four constructs, each containing an internal GFP at a distinct site within the WD40 domain. The two constructs containing an internal GFP at either residue 115 or 370 (EED-GFP115 and EED-GFP370) assembled into stoichiometric and stable complexes that were used for EM analysis (Figure 7A, panels I and II, respectively). Comparing the internally GFP-tagged EED sample with the untagged form allowed us to identify the additional GFP density protruding from the WD40-shaped Lobe A (Figure 7A). To further confirm this localization, we reconstituted and analyzed a complex containing an N-terminal MBP on Ezh2. According to the known crystal structure (Han et al., 2007), the EED WD40 domain interacts with the N-terminal region of Ezh2. Therefore, an MBP in this region should localize similarly to Lobe A. Consistent with this prediction, 2D analysis of this construct showed additional density corresponding to an MBP tag protruding from Lobe A (Figure 7B). Based on the positions of the two internal GFP tags for EED and the MBP tag for Ezh2, we were able to accurately orient the EED-Ezh2 crystal structure within the 3D EM density. This information, together with the crystal structure of histone H3-bound EED (Margueron et al., 2009), suggests that the canonical histone H3-binding site is located in a cavity at the intersection of Lobe A and Arm 2 (Figure 7C)."

To test this idea, we reconstituted complexes carrying an N-terminal MBP or and internal or C-terminal GFP tag on RbAp48, but none of these fusion constructs produced a stable and stoichiometric complex. To overcome this limitation, we again took advantage on the known interaction between Nurf55 (Drosophila ortholog of RbAp48) and Suz12 that has been structurally characterized (Nowak et al., 2011; Schmitges et al., 2011). We generated a complex bearing an internal GFP tag immediately after the alpha helix of Suz12 that interacts with RbAp48 (Suz12-GFP123). In this particular case, the canonical view was not as well represented and the label was more clearly seen in a different orientation (Figure 8A). The GFP can be seen localizing to Lobe D, confirming that Suz12 interacts with the RbAp48 propeller at this position."

The WD40 propeller and protruding N-terminal alpha-helix of RbAp48 were accommodated within this region with high fidelity. The docked crystal structure of the histone H3-bound RbAp48 (Nowak et al., 2011; Schmitges et al., 2011) provides further insight into histone binding. Attached to RbAp48 at Lobe D, the histone would face Lobe C (Figure 8B), suggesting that the histone H3 tail is situated in a head-to-tail orientation, running vertically from the bottom end of the complex in Lobe D towards Lobe B."

To localize the two SANT domains, we reconstituted PRC2-AEBP2 complexes containing either a GFP label downstream of the first SANT domain (Ezh2-GFP303, Figure 9A, panel II; see also Figure 9—figure supplement 1) or immediately upstream of the second SANT domain (Ezh2-GFP436, Figure 9A, panel III). The location of the GFP extra density suggests that the first SANT domain is positioned at the intersection of Lobe A and Arm 1, and the second at the intersection of Arm 1 and Lobe B. The proximity of these two SANT domains is in very good agreement with our cross-linking analysis (Figure 5)."

Analysis of the 2D class averages indicates that the SET domain begins at Lobe B and terminates above EED in Lobe A. Figure 9B summarized our Ezh2 labeling results (proposed chain path in inset): the two SANT domains span Arm 1 and Lobe B, while the C-terminal SET domain is located between Lobes A and B. Our identification of a cross-link between the first Ezh2 SANT domain and the N-terminus of EED (Figure 5) further suggest that the N-terminal region of EED localizes to Arm1 (Figure 11). In agreement with our tagged-based localization, crystal structures for homologous SANT and domains and SET domains (PDBs: 3HM5 and 3H6L) fit well within the assigned lobes in the EM structure (Figure 11 and Movie 2)."

The position of the Suz12 VEFS domain with respect to the Ezh2 SET domain suggests how the H3K4me3 and H3K36me2/3 inhibition via Suz12 could be transferred to Ezh2, regulating its methyltransferase activity. The close proximity of these elements could also explain why the gene activation marks need to be on the tail being modified in order to block methyltransferase activity."

      "content": "In summary, our structure offers a three dimensional framework showing how various elements of the PRC2 complex involved in regulated histone-binding can act either independently or synergistically in response to different chromatin environments. Importantly, our PRC2 subunit organization is consistent with previously proposed models of PRC2 activity (Margueron et al., 2009; Schmitges et al., 2011): when chromatin domains are targeted for repression, PRC2 is recruited to deposit the repressive H3K27me3 histone mark at nucleosome-associated regions of DNA. Existing H3K27me3 marks are recognized by EED and, possibly in cooperation with Ezh2's SANT domains, Ezh2 methyltransferase activity is increased (Figure 12A). To ensure that H3K27 trimethylation is limited only to the repressed target, PRC2 is capable of repressing its own enzymatic activity. When PRC2 comes into contact with the boundary of an active gene, the interaction between H3K4me3, H3K36me2, and H3K36me3 with the VEFS domain of Suz12, could be propagated to the Ezh2 subunit, blocking PRC2 activity (Figure 12B)."

Molecular explanations for this substrate preference have been largely hypothetical in the absence of any structural information. The positioning of the different subunits within the PRC2 structure suggests a model of how PRC2 could interact with a dinucleosome, by placing the regions interacting with histone tails in opposite sides of the complex, thus allowing interaction with two nucleosomes simultaneously, without any steric hindrance. Figure 13 suggests a possible arrangement illustrating this point that also agrees with the proposed binding of AEBP2 to nucleosomal DNA (Kim et al., 2009). In such arrangement, EED binding to one nucleosome would position the histone H3 tail from the second nucleosome in close proximity to the Ezh2 SET domain (Figure 13)."

Furthermore, the functional mapping of different activities within the physical shape of the complex leads to novel, testable hypotheses on how PRC2 interacts with chromatin that should inspire future research of PRC2 function and regulation. Given the similarity in sequence between PRC2 components from different species, we expect the molecular architecture that we described for human PRC2 to be conserved throughout higher eukaryotes."

AEBP2 was subcloned in frame with a N-terminal StrepII tag into the pFastBac1 shuttle vector. All the other components were subcloned in the same vector in frame with a N-terminal hexahistidine tag. For PRC2 component localization, all the subunits were sub-cloned into a modified pFastBac1 vector in frame with either an N-terminal maltose binding protein or an internal or C-terminal GFP. All clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated in Sf9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac kit (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) according to manufacturer's recommendations. For protein expression, High5 cells were grown in suspension culture in ESF921 serum-free medium (Expression Systems, Davis, CA, USA) and infected with the right combination of viruses at a density of 1.0 × 106 ml−1. Cells were harvested 60–72 hr post-infection and lysed by sonication in 25 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 138 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet-P40 (NP40) and 1 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT) (supplemented with protease inhibitors). All samples were affinity-purified on Strep-Tactin Superflow Plus resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) using an N-terminal Strep-tag II tag on the AEBP2 subunit. The complex was eluted from the resin by competition with lysis buffer containing 10 mM Desthiobiotin. The complex was then immediately subjected to size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a calibrated Superose 6 PC 3.2/30 column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) at 4°C equilibrated in SEC buffer (25 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 138 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 0.05% NP40, 1 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride [TCEP]). To preserve protein stability for structure determination, Prc2 protein complexes were cross-linked with 0.015% Glutaraldehyde for 10 minutes and the reaction stopped with 1M Tris, pH 8.0. Protein elution was monitored at 280 nm and protein fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie brilliant blue staining."

Tandem mass spectra of precursors differing in their mass by 6.037660475 Da (difference between DSSG-d0 and DSS-d6) were paired if they had a charge state of 3+ to 8+ and were triggered within 2.5 min of each other. These spectra were then searched against a pre-processed .fasta database. A valid identification of the cross-linked peptides required at least four bond cleavages in total or three in a series for each peptide and a minimum peptide length of six amino acids."

The ACE2 and CTFFind programs (Mindell and Grigorieff, 2003; Mallick et al., 2005) ran concurrently with data collection to estimate the contrast transfer function (CTF) of the micrographs, as well as to provide a quantitative measurement of the quality of the imaging. At the same time, a template-based particle picker using the representative views of PRC2 (described above) located particles on the micrograph. At the end of data collection, the phases of the micrograph were corrected with ACE2, and individual particles were extracted using a box size of 224 × 224 pixels and decimated by a factor of 2. Any pixels whose values were above or below 4.5 sigma of the mean pixel value were removed using the XMIPP normalization function (Scheres et al., 2008). In order to remove inappropriately selected protein aggregates, stain crystals, carbon edges, or other forms of contamination, particles whose mean or standard deviation deviated significantly from the norm were removed. The remaining particles were subjected to a single round of MSA and classification (Ogura et al., 2003), in which thousands of class averages were generated with ∼20 particles per class. The resulting class averages were manually inspected to remove remaining aggregation, contamination, false positive particle selections, and very small particles potentially corresponding to incomplete PRC2 complexes. Following these particle-cleaning steps, the remaining 39,527 particles were subjected to several rounds of MSA and MRA using the IMAGIC software package (van Heel et al., 1996) to produce detailed views of the PRC2 complex with high signal-to-noise ratios."

We concentrated any further efforts on classes corresponding to the canonical view. The full set of tagged particles corresponding to this projection view gives rise to a class average with very good signal for the complex, as well as some extra density, corresponding to the tag, which is distinctive but typically smeared to different extents for different samples due to the flexibility of the tag. For a clearer visualization of the tag, we subclassified particles within this view. Two examples of the subclassification are shown for GFP-tagged complexes in Figure 9—figure supplement 1. The pivoting of the tag density can be clearly seen in these classes and in Movie 1. The percentage of subclasses clearly showing the tag ranges from 100% for a significant number of labels to 57% for the least favorable case (likely due to proteolysis). For the generation of the figures in the main text of the paper we chose to show a single subclass average with a larger number of particles that accurately resembles the full ensemble, but that more clearly shows the density of the tag, nicely corresponding to the mass expected for proteins of their size. These classes were then compared to the wild-type PRC2 class averages through cross-correlation using the SPIDER ‘AP SH’ command. After alignment, the matching class averages for the untagged and tagged complexes were individually normalized and then the PRC2 class averages were subtracted from the PRC2-tagged class averages. The densities seen in the difference maps were at least 3-standard deviations above the mean, showing the location of tagged-PRC2 subunits."

These data were collected in an automated fashion using the RCT-Raster application in Leginon (Yoshioka et al., 2007). Particles were automatically selected using the DoG particle picker (Voss et al., 2009), and the tilt axis, as well as the particle-pair assignments, were calculated automatically with the TiltPicker module of Appion TiltPicker (Voss et al., 2009). Particles were extracted in the same manner as described in the previous section, resulting in 6075 particle pairs. The XMIPP ML2D program was used to generate 20 reference-free 2D averages from the 0° micrographs, each class containing between 150 and 800 particles (Scheres et al., 2008). Generation of more than 20 classes did not reveal conformers that were notably different from the reconstructions resulting from the initial classes, and suffered in resolution due to the decreased number of particles attributed to each class. SPIDER routines integrated into Appion were used to generate 3D RCT reconstructions for each of these class averages."

The class averages were then back-projected according to their assigned Euler angles to provide a three-dimensional model based solely on 0° particles data. The resulting 3D reconstructions, albeit at low resolution, were highly consistent, indicating that there is one major architectural state of the complex. We used the reconstruction obtained from the more populated RCT class as the initial model for refinement against single particles of the full 0° data set. Since potential end-on views of the complex were not considered during structure determination, as they could not be distinguished from partial complexes, we relied on ‘tomographic’ coverage of the views along the long axis of the structure. This refinement was performed using an iterative projection-matching script that makes use of libraries from the SPARX and EMAN2 image processing packages (Baldwin and Penczek, 2007; Tang et al., 2007)."
