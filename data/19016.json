With recent six-player public goods experiments, we demonstrated that the threat of shame or the promise of honor led to increased cooperation. Participants were told in advance that after ten rounds two participants would be asked to come forward and write their names on the board in front of the fellow group members. In the shame treatment, the least cooperative players were exposed and wrote their names under the sentence \u201cI donated least\u201d while the honored participants wrote their name under \u201cI donated most.\u201d In both the shame and honor treatments, participants contributed approximately 50% more to the public good, as compared with the control treatment in which all players retained their anonymity. Here, we also discuss how shame and honor differ from full transparency, and some of the challenges to understanding how anonymity and exposure modify behavior."

We recently tested this question with a public goods game, a type of experiment often used to study the conflict between group and self-interest.1,2 Over 12 rounds, six participants recruited from the same class could choose to invest a certain amount of their allotted capital, endowed to them at the start of the game, into a common pool or keep it. The total investments in the common pool were then doubled and equally divided among all participants. Thus, in each game non-contributors are better off than cooperators that contributed to the common pool. However, a group of non-contributors does not increase their initial capital, whereas a group of cooperators doubles their income. This generates a social dilemma characterized by the conflict of interest between the individual and the group.3.4 This conflict of interest was beautifully illustrated by one student in a questionnaire handed out at the end of the experiments (Fig.\u00a01)."

For example, the fear of being shamed for not adhering to standards for personal hygiene might encourage adherence to a social norm without the fear of physical punishment, fines, or incarceration. Shame and honor can be considered sub-classifications of punishment and reward. Whitman5 sorts punishments into five sorts of deprivations: life (execution); liberty (imprisonment); bodily safety (corporal violence); property (fines); and what he calls \u201cdignity\u201d (shaming). We would also consider two more potential deprivations: access to the group (ostracism) and manipulation of social status (gossip). Shaming, ostracism and gossip are often non-regulatory in the sense that members of the public can legally exert these punishments, while the law often consigns the use of execution, imprisonment, corporal violence and fines as exclusive punishments of the state."

Nevertheless, punishment is ubiquitous in human and animal societies.6 Interestingly, theoretical and experimental work suggests that voluntary participation in social enterprises\u2014which corresponds to the positive complement of ostracism\u2014could be key, following Hardin\u2019s2 principle of \u2018mutual coercion mutually agreed upon\u2019. This principle has been demonstrated in recent theoretical work, where punishment behavior and sanctioning institutions can evolve if individuals voluntarily commit to such a social norm7,8 and in experiments, where participants prefer\u2014after an initial aversion and some adjustment time\u2014public goods interactions that allow punishment of other participants.9,10 Shaming and ostracism are two economic ways to inflict potentially severe and harmful sanctions on individuals."

Here, reputation and gossip play a decisive role in establishing and maintaining cooperation.12 In particular, cooperation thrives if individuals gain reputation through cooperative actions and target their cooperative efforts toward others that have a high reputation. To learn the reputation of potential interaction partners, the spread of information or gossip becomes essential.13 Similarly, gossip about whether an individual punishes non-contributors is predicted to help to enforce social norms and to stabilize cooperation.14 The efficient interplay between reputation and punishment to promote cooperation has been demonstrated in an experimental setup.10"

In contrast, policies that aim to shame or honor expose only a section of the population, such as the delinquent tax websites in many US states, and the threshold for acceptable behavior is often implicit. However, with shame and honor it can still be difficult to determine at which point behavior becomes aberrant. For taxpayers in arrears, for instance, some US states publish the names of only the top 250 delinquent taxpayers or those owing more than a certain amount (e.g., $100,000). In our own experiment, one group in the shame treatment was highly cooperative: five players fully cooperated and gave $10 over 10 rounds and one player gave $9. In this case, we tweaked the game, and at the end of 10 rounds exposed only the one player who gave $9. Moreover, in this case, we questioned whether the reference point of the group's average to determine what was \u2018shameful\u2019 was useful\u2014shame and honor are probably most efficient when there is wide variance in behavior."

In another eight-round game, players could see only digital photographs of all five group members along with their donations at each round and contributions increased from 30.3% of possible donations in an anonymous treatment to 48.1%,17 or a calculated 60%. In a third design, the group of four players could talk before and after the experiments but were anonymous to each other until the tenth and final round, when all players\u2019 identities were revealed; group contributions increased from 50.5% of total possible contributions under anonymous conditions to 70.5%,18 which translates to a 40% increase."

In comparison, our experiments exposed only two out of six players and achieved a similar increase in cooperation. Groups threatened with shame and enticed with honor donated 53% and 48% more, respectively, than groups who could rely on retaining their anonymity. While the players \u2018honored\u2019 after round 10 gave significantly more than their co-players that remained anonymous (2 sample t-test, nh(exposed) = 20, nh(anon) = 40, t = 5.91, p < 0.0001; the player is the statistical unit; all statistical tests are 2-tailed; Fig.\u00a02), and the later \u2018shamed\u2019 players gave significantly less (2 sample t-test, ns(exposed) = 19, ns(anon) = 41, t = -4.03, p < 0.0017; Fig.\u00a02), the overall differences over the course of the first 10 rounds cannot be accounted for by the increased contributions of those participants that lost their anonymity and hence suggests that the patterns observed are not necessarily driven by the effects of publicity on low- or high-contributing participants. Instead, all players cooperated more."

Overall, the distributions of the numbers of players giving higher amounts shifted with the threat of shame or honor (Fig.\u00a03). However, to clearly identify differences between the effects of transparency, anonymity, shame and honor further experimental work is required. For instance, would cooperation also increase if groups were told two random players of the six would be exposed with their contribution rank? This set-up would demonstrate whether (and to what degree) cooperation increases due to the threat of mere exposure, as opposed to the threat of exposure for extreme behavior, as in our experiment."

Many questions also remain related to the long-term consequences of shame and honor. We ran two additional rounds after exposure (Fig.\u00a04) and saw that anonymous players in both the shame and honor treatments gave nearly equal amounts, while players who were honored contributed more in the final two rounds (and significantly more in the 12th round) than those who were shamed, suggesting that those who earned an honorable reputation felt obliged to maintain it."
