# Lens

**eLife Lens** provides a novel way of looking at content on the web. It is designed to make life easier for researchers, reviewers, authors and readers. For example, have you tried to look at a figure in an online article, while at the same time trying to see what the author says about the figure, jumping all around the article, losing track of what you were looking for in the first place? The reason for this is that most online research articles are published in a fixed digital version of the original paper. With eLife Lens, we take full advantage of the internetâ€™s flexibility.

For a demo and more information see: http://lens.elifesciences.org

Lens is composed of some independent modules. Those are:

- The [Lens Article Format](http://github.com/elifesciences/lens-article) is a JSON based document model designed for representing scientific content. It features basic content types such as paragraphs, headings, and various figure types such as images, tables and videos complete with captions and cross-references.
- The [Lens Reader](http://github.com/elifesciences/lens-reader) is the implementation of the article reader, it can be embedded into any page
- The [Lens Outline](http://github.com/elifesciences/lens-outline) is the visual document map we are using in Lens. It can be used independently.
